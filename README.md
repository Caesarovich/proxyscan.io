# proxyscan.io

## A NodeJS wrapper for [proxyscan.io](https://proxyscan.io)'s API

Fetch proxies lists with ease from the [proxyscan.io API](https://proxyscan.io/api).
This packages comes with TS types and JSDoc for ease of use in development.

## 📥 Installation

You can install this library with the [NPM package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) with the following command:

```
npm install proxyscan.io
```

**Alternatively** you can build your own version with the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Caesarovich/proxyscan.io.git
cd proxyscan.io && npm i
npm build
```

This will build the package into the `dist` directory.

## ⏳ Quick start

You first need to import the library.

```js
const proxyscan-io = require('proxyscan.io');
```

Then use the `fetchProxies` function to fetch proxies from the API.

```js
import { fetchProxies } from 'proxyscan.io';

fetchProxies()
  .then(console.log) // [ {ip: 1.1.1.1, ...} ]
  .catch(console.error);
```

## 📔 Documentation

### fetchProxies(options?: FetchOptions)

The `fetchProxies` function will make an HTTP GET call to the API and retrieve results based on the specified options.

**Example:**

```js
import { fetchProxies } from 'proxyscan.io';

fetchProxies().then(console.log);

/*
  [
    {
      "ip": "185.208.100.72",
      "port": 4145,
      "ping": 21,
      "time": 1630973749,
      ...
    }
  ]
*/
```

#### Returns: Promise<Proxy[]>

### FetchOptions

The fetch options allows for more precise API requests. I strongly recommend using at least some.

| Option      | Value                               | Description                                                 |

| port        | Number (1 - 65535)                  | Proxies with a specific port                                |
| ping        | Number                              | How fast you get a response after you've sent out a request |
| limit       | Number (1 - 20)                     | How many proxies to list.                                   |
| uptime      | Number (1 - 100)                    | How reliably a proxy has been running                       |
| country     | String (eg: 'EN, US')               | Country of the proxy                                        |
| not_country | String (eg: 'CN, NL')               | Avoid proxy countries                                       |

> Note: using `format: 'txt'` will result in the function returning a `Promise\<String>`.
